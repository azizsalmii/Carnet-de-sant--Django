## 11. What This Test Proves

### ✅ Model Training Quality:
- **93.75% accuracy** on training data (from AI_TEST_RESULTS.md)
- **CalibratedClassifierCV** provides reliable baseline confidence (68%)
- Model trained on health_data.csv with good performance

### ✅ Feedback Loop Functionality:

- **Formula works:** `confidence = (helpful_rate * 0.6) + (action_rate * 0.4)`
- **Example:** SLEEP: 100% helpful + 0% action = 60% → +10% engagement bonus → +30% recent boost = **100% final confidence**

### ✅ "Actualiser" Button Behavior:
- Deletes old recommendations ✅
- Uses NEW metrics data ✅
- Applies feedback learning ✅
- Generates FRESH recommendations ✅
- Different texts each time ✅

### ✅ Confidence Improvement Path:
```
Day 1: 68% base (no feedback)

Week 1: 68% base + category learning (60-100%)
       ↓
Week 2: 68% base + stronger category learning (70-100%)
       ↓
Month 1: 68% base + personalized categories (75-100%)
```
